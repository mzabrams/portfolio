    abstract = "{Cavitation has been shown to have implications for head injury, but currently there is no solution for detecting the formation of cavitation through the skull during blunt impact. The goal of this communication is to confirm the wideband acoustic wavelet signature of cavitation collapse, and determine that this signature can be differentiated from the noise of a blunt impact. A controlled, laser induced cavitation study was conducted in an isolated water tank to confirm the wide band acoustic signature of cavitation collapse in the absence of a blunt impact. A clear acrylic surrogate head was impacted to induce blunt impact cavitation. The bubble formation was imaged using a high speed camera, and the collapse was synched up with the wavelet transform of the acoustic emission. Wideband acoustic response is seen in wavelet transform of positive laser induced cavitation tests, but absent in laser induced negative controls. Clear acrylic surrogate tests showed the wideband acoustic wavelet signature of collapse can be differentiated from acoustic noise generated by a blunt impact. Broadband acoustic signal can be used as a biomarker to detect the incidence of cavitation through the skull as it consists of frequencies that are low enough to potentially pass through the skull but high enough to differentiate from blunt impact noise. This lays the foundation for a vital tool to conduct CSF cavitation research in-vivo.}",

  abstract={Since 1975, the US has seen a decrease in vehicle crash fatalities, noticeably among recent model
vehicles. However, a lack of requirement to test motor vehicles using anthropomorphic test devices
representative of both the average male and the average female occupant may be driving a disparity in the risk
of fatality in severe crash scenarios. The double pair comparison method, first developed by Evans, was applied
to many different cross-sections of the US Fatality Analysis Reporting System to investigate sex-dependent
differences in relative fatality risk in crashes. Despite a dramatic decline in fatalities over the reporting period,
female vehicle occupants aged 20–30 years are 20–25% more likely to die as a result of a fatal crash than males
in the same age range. The risk to females and males becomes similar as age increases to 60. These trends hold
when looking at subsets of crashes in either rural or urban areas, when looking at vehicles manufactured since
2010, and when isolating by single, two- or multiple-vehicle crashes. The consistency of this age-dependent
relative risk emphasises a need to further investigate sex differences in crash-related outcomes. },

	abstract={The occurrence of cavitation in the brain from blunt impact is difficult to investigate and remains
controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate cavitation formation from blunt impact, without
compromising the cranial cavity, using novel acoustic biomarkers. These biomarkers were developed using a
laser-induced cavitation study, acrylic surrogate impact tests, and fresh non-frozen pig cadaver impact tests.
Laser-induced cavitation displayed a ~125 and 250 kHz response on high frequency sensors, and a ~13–20 kHz,
~50–70 kHz and ~100–140 kHz frequency response on hydrophones. For surrogate tests, a harmonic response
(~50–70, 100–140 and 250 kHz) was recorded 0–5 ms following confirmed cavitation impacts. In cadaver tests,
largest impacts elicited a coupled low frequency (~50–70 kHz) and high frequency (~100–140 kHz) acoustic
response 0–5 ms following impact. Negative control pig cadaver head tests provided low frequency response but
were not associated with high frequency content for any impact. Using a series of validation tests and negative
controls, this study developed an acoustic biomarker, a low frequency response coupled with a high frequency
harmonic, which is sensitive and specific to CSF cavitation without compromising the cranial cavity. This provided
evidence of cavitation within a fresh pig cadaver skull upon blunt impact.},

	abstract={Known sex-based physiological and biomechanical differences do not explain the much larger
fatality risk to young women in car crashes compared with men under matched conditions,
suggesting a need for expanded test methodologies and research strategies to address as-yet
unexplored sex contributing to crash outcomes. Vehicle occupants who died in crashes with at
least two occupants between 1975 and 2018 were examined. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data was used to calculate
relative risk using a modified Double Pair Comparison method, with a bootstrap estimation for
determining confidence intervals. This method matches subject occupants exhibiting one of two
characteristics based on the characteristics of a common control occupant in the same vehicle.
Participants were matched using vehicle seating location, vehicle type, airbag deployment,
seatbelt usage, age and a control occupant. Male (n=205,325) and female (n=126,075) vehicle
occupants sustaining fatal injury in passenger car or light truck crashes between 1975 and 2018
were examined. This population was binned by crash year (1975-2018, n=331,400; 1999-2018,
n=112,032; 2010-2018, n=36,481; 2015-2018, n=14,796). Across all conditions, 25-year-old
female vehicle occupants in crashes from 2010-2018 exhibit a relative fatality risk of 1.107 (95%
CI 1.097 – 1.116) compared to 25-year-old male occupants. There is an age-dependent risk to
females in vehicle crashes, with younger females at higher risk of death than younger males. This
difference is robust across many variables, and is not attributable to vehicle weight, belt usage, or
airbag deployment. Female vehicle occupants aged 20–30 years are 20–25% more likely to die as
a result of a fatal crash than males in the same age range. Known sex-based differences do not
explain this large risk differential, and should be further examined to ensure all occupants are
well-protected.},

  abstract={Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death both in the United States and around the world.
While research has showed younger females are at increased risk of fatality in fatal crashes, the underlying cause
of this disparity is unclear. Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), Mortality Multiple Cause of
Death (MCOD), and National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) were used
with the double-pair comparison method to identify relative risk of head injury and injury to other major body
systems in motor vehicle crashes. FARS cases were linked to detailed cause of death records in MCOD. Young
female occupants are at increased risk of fatal and severe head and abdominal injuries in motor vehicle crashes.
This increased risk is pronounced for young females in both fatal crashes and non-fatal crashes with severe
injuries. Along with previous research pointing to an increased overall fatality risk for young females in fatal
crashes, these findings suggest a need to more carefully study biomechanical sex differences in car crashes.},

  abstract={Instrumented mouthguard systems are used to study rigid body head kinematics in vivo in a
variety of athletic environments. Previous work has assessed these systems when rigidly attached to
anthropomorphic test device (ATD) heads and found good fidelity compared with reference sensors. Here, we
examine the fidelity of two instrumented boil-and-bite mouthguards (iMGs) in helmeted, human cadaver impact
tests at three velocities and three impact locations. The Prevent Biometrics iMG correlates with reference linear
acceleration up to approximately 60 g, underestimating impacts at higher magnitudes. The Prevent iMG
correlates well with angular velocity, while underestimating angular acceleration past approximately 3,000 rad/s^2.
The DTS iMG consistently overestimates angular acceleration and velocity, and transformed linear kinematics are
not well-correlated to reference kinematics at the head centre of gravity (HCG) for these impact conditions.
Future work should examine the influence of the mandible and subject-specific mouthguard fit on fidelity of
impact kinematics. This study highlights the need for cadaver validation studies of wearable head impact
instrumentation systems, particularly when considering realistic (non-idealised) sensor-skull coupling and
accounting for interactions with the mandible. }
