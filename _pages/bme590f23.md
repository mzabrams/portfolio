In fall 2023, I served as an instructional teaching assistant for the course BME 590: Neurotrauma at Duke University. As an instructional TA for this course, my primary roles involved restructuring the course to align better with the research interests and background of the lead instructor, developing and delivering lectures, and designing projects for the students. Some sample course materials are provided below.
