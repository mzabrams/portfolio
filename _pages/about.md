I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in the Duke University Injury Biomechanics Lab, where I work with Dr. Jason Luck, and formerly Dr. Cameron R. 'Dale' Bass (now at Wayne State University). My research interests center around both sex differences in injuries and fatalities as well as concussions and brain injuries in sports. 

My research on sex differences in motor vehicle fatalities was recognized with the Gundolf Beier Award by the International Research Council on the Biomechanics of Injury in 2022, highlighting research with a high potential to influence the field of traffic safety. Recently, I was invited to a workgroup meeting of the UNECE Informal Working Group on Equitable Occupant Protection to discuss some of this work as well.

Or not, up to you... Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
