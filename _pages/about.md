I am a  5th year PhD Candidate in the Duke University Injury Biomechanics Lab, where I work with Dr. Jason Luck, and formerly Dr. Cameron R. 'Dale' Bass (now at Wayne State University). My research interests center around both sex differences in injuries and fatalities as well as concussions and brain injuries in sports. 

My research on sex differences in motor vehicle fatalities was recognized 
with the Gundolf Beier Award by the International Research Council on the 
Biomechanics of Injury in 2022, highlighting research with a high 
potential to influence the field of traffic safety. Recently, I was 
invited to a workgroup meeting of the UN ECE GRSP Informal Working Group 
on Equitable Occupant Protection to discuss some of this work as well.

Currently, I am an instructional teaching assistant for BME 590: Neurotrauma.
